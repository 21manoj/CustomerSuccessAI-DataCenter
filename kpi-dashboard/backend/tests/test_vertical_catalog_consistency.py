Vertical catalog consistency — guard tests (Aug 21 2026, vertical-coupling audit).

A live audit against customer 390 (datacenter_v1) found get_kpi_catalog serving
dc2_s's 5-pillar names/weights to a 6-pillar customer, with its own vertical
field correctly reporting 'datacenter_v1' — an internally inconsistent
response. Root cause: get_kpi_catalog hardcoded a two-branch if/else
(saas_premium via a direct module import, everything else silently defaulted
to DC2S_PILLARS) instead of using utils.vertical_registry, the loader the
rest of the codebase already uses correctly. The saas_premium branch was
ALSO broken — verticals/saas_premium/kpi_definitions.py has no
SAAS_PILLAR_WEIGHTS symbol — so its except ImportError fell through to the
same dc2_s default. Every vertical except dc2_s was silently served dc2_s's
catalog. Separately, get_vertical_config referenced _get_playbook_config
without importing it — a NameError on a prospect-facing, no-auth discovery
tool. And partner_portal hardcoded pillar_code='P4' as "the partner pillar,"
which is only true in dc2_s/saas_premium — in datacenter_v1, P4 is Power &
Facility, so the portal was handing a channel partner the customer's
facility data under partner labels.

Fixes:
  - get_kpi_catalog now sources PILLARS/default_l2 from vertical_registry
    and raises ToolError (no silent fallback) if that fails.
  - get_vertical_config's cs_pulse_onboarding.py import list now includes
    _get_playbook_config.
  - partner_portal refuses to serve (ToolError) unless the tenant's own
    declared P4 pillar name is literally "Channel & Partner Health" — a
    content check, not a per-vertical lookup table (which would just
    relocate the same defect). A pillar_roles registry replaces this with
    a proper role lookup later; this is the interim control.

Update (Phase 2, same day): the pillar_roles registry promised above has
landed — `config/*_kpi_catalog.json` now each carry a `pillar_roles` block
(role_name -> pillar_code) and `utils.vertical_registry.role(vertical,
role_name)` resolves it. partner_portal's gate was retrofitted from the
'partner' substring-on-P4-name check to `role(vertical, 'partner')`, and
the tests below were updated to match — see
test_partner_portal_gate_condition_matches_every_registered_vertical and
test_every_vertical_role_resolves_to_own_catalog_or_none.

These tests import no Flask app and need no DB — same convention as
test_mcp_tool_auth_coverage.py and test_vertical_playbook_routing.py.
