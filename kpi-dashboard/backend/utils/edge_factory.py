"""
EdgeFactory (WS-2 2c) — the sanctioned path for writing a causal edge that
the platform inferred rather than observed as fact.

Per the WS-2 review (2026-08-24): "NULLing confidence alone was rejected as
a half-fix — rows neither confidently-wrong nor honestly-labelled, with
unaudited NULL-handling downstream." The fix is NULL confidence PAIRED with
a stamped evidence_tier (utils/provenance.py's observed/inferred/synthetic
vocabulary), so a NULL here always means "no calibrated estimate exists",
never "forgot to set it" or "defaulted to trusted". Every edge still routes
through utils.context_graph.upsert_edge, so the I1/I2/I17 pre-commit
invariants and from/to-pair dedup apply exactly as they do to every other
writer — this module supplies the confidence/evidence_tier/derivation
discipline on top, it does not bypass graph integrity.

`derivation` distinguishes system.self (the platform reacting to its own
prior inference or trigger condition — playbook auto-triggers, heuristic
close-linking) from system.external (a genuinely external logged fact — SoR
sync, a recorded trigger condition). WS-2 matrix Hold 1 signed cell 14
(playbook_auto_trigger x TRIGGERED) `observed` only on condition that
Evidence Density's observed-denominator excludes every system.self
derivation — otherwise the metric inflates every time more auto-triggers
ship. See tests/test_evidence_density_contract.py.
