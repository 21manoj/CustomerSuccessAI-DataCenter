"""
Provenance vocabulary for context graph nodes/edges.

Three values describe how a node or edge entered the graph:

  observed  — came directly from customer-uploaded data (CSV ingest,
              SoR sync). The fact is asserted by the customer.
  inferred  — came from runtime inference over real customer signals
              (signal_analyst, urgent_signal_scanner, LLM Tier-1 enrichment,
              push_intelligence). Not asserted by the customer but grounded
              in their actual data.
  synthetic — fabricated from a template independent of the customer's
              actual data (Wizard A arc-template-driven nodes, demo seeders).
              Useful for narrative scaffolding; NOT to be used as evidence
              in correlation/forecast fitting.

Default reader filter for any model that fits weights or makes predictions
(Wizard B correlation, Wizard C NRR validation, NRR forecast):

    WHERE source IN ('observed', 'inferred')

Synthetic rows are still returned by UI/journey queries — the filter is
only for downstream learners and outcome-economics calculations.

Edge-confidence threshold (paired with provenance for Wizard B/C):
    Even within ('observed', 'inferred'), an edge with confidence < 0.6
    is considered too noisy for correlation fitting.
