## 📈 **CHURN & LIFETIME VALUE ANALYSIS**

### **From Sim6 Data:**
```
Churn Rate: 35% over 12 days
Implied Monthly Churn: ~87.5% (too high, extrapolated)
Realistic Monthly Churn: 10-15% (industry standard)
```

### **LTV Calculation (Conservative - 15% monthly churn):**
```
Average Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.15 = 6.67 months
LTV = $9.99 × 6.67 = $66.63 per premium user

If conversion is 20%:
LTV per user (all): $66.63 × 0.20 = $13.33
```

### **LTV Calculation (Optimistic - 10% monthly churn):**
```
Average Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.10 = 10 months
LTV = $9.99 × 10 = $99.90 per premium user

If conversion is 30%:
LTV per user (all): $99.90 × 0.30 = $29.97
```

## 🎯 **INSIGHTS IMPACT ON MRR**

### **From Sim6 Results:**
```
With Insights:    43.2% conversion
Without Insights: 5.4% conversion

44% of users got insights (need 15+ check-ins)
```

### **MRR Impact Model:**

**If We Improve Insights Penetration:**
