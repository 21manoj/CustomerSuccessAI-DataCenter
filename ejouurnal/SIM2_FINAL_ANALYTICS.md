### **MRR Breakdown:**
```
Premium Users: 374
Price: $7.99/month

MRR: $2,988.26

Casual:        71 × $7.99 = $567.29  (19% of MRR)
Strugglers:    17 × $7.99 = $135.83  (4% of MRR)
```

**Key Finding:** Engaged users drive 65% of revenue!

---

### **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):**
```
Total Revenue: $2,988.26/month
Active Users: 655

**Value Props:**
- Unlimited journals (vs 3 free)
- Deep insights (correlations, lags)
- Cloud backup
- Priority features

---

### **4. FEATURE PRIORITIES:**

**High Impact:**
1. **MDW Gamification** (restoration challenges → help casuals)
2. **Onboarding Optimization** (improve D7 retention to 85%+)
3. **Day 7 Conversion Flow** (optimize prime moment)

**Medium Impact:**
4. Advanced Insights
5. Purpose Programs
6. Social (anti-glitter)
